<p class="strong-green">watchtower is actionable competitive intelligence</p>
<p>
Watchtower is a platform for monitoring changes to your competitor's website and product. Using watchtower is simple and with a few clicks, you can start setting up trackers to monitor when sites change their design, start doing A/B tests, or customize their content to specific users. You do this in a point and click interface so anyone can use this tool to keep track of and respond to the competition regardless of technical ability.
</p><p>Watchtower was borne out of a desire to help businesses maintain a competitive edge. How often have you mentioned to a colleague some interesting design change or test that a competitor has done to their website? Now imagine instead of missing the majority of those changes or finding out about them from YOUR BOSS, you become the most informed person in your organization.
</p>
<p>
In order to crush the enemy, you must first KNOW the enemy. Watchtower is your first step in knowing and you know they say, knowing is half the battle.
